## VW Coin Algorithm

Our algorithm dynamically evaluates each vehicle’s operational risk by combining three main factors: engine hours, distance traveled (odometer), and operational context (e.g., urban, highway, off-road). Here’s how it works:

1. **Risk Threshold Calculation**  
   We compute a risk threshold `T(H)` that decreases as engine hours increase. The formula is:  

   ```
   T(H) = R_max / (1 + gamma * H)
   ```

   - `R_max` is the maximum distance allowed under ideal conditions (e.g., 500 km).
   - `gamma` is a sensitivity parameter (in 1/h) that controls how quickly the threshold decreases with increased engine hours.
   - `H` is the total engine hours.  
     
   This means that if a vehicle has low engine hours (H is small), the full bonus capacity (`R_max`) is available. As H increases, the threshold declines, reflecting increased risk.

2. **Risk Factor Derivation**  
   The algorithm then derives a Risk Factor that combines the normalized odometer reading with engine hours. In practice, higher odometer values and higher engine hours lead to a higher risk factor, which can be used to visually color-code data points (for example, in a scatter plot) to identify high-risk vehicles quickly.

3. **Penalty Calculation (Optional)**  
   In addition to assessing risk, the algorithm can calculate a penalty score to deduct points for negative behavior. The penalty is calculated as follows:

   ```
   Penalty = 20 * (1 + alpha * (odometer / R_max)) * (1 + beta * h_ratio)
   ```

   - `20` is the base penalty (points).
   - `odometer / R_max` normalizes the distance traveled.
   - `h_ratio` is a normalized measure of engine hours (e.g., current engine hours divided by a reference value).
   - `alpha` and `beta` are coefficients that determine how much each factor contributes to the penalty.

   This multiplicative formula ensures that vehicles covering more distance and operating for longer hours incur higher penalties, thereby discouraging risky behavior.

---

**Summary:**  
- The **threshold model** reduces bonus accumulation capacity with increased engine hours, using the formula `T(H) = R_max / (1 + gamma * H)`.
- A **Risk Factor** is derived by combining normalized distance and engine hours, helping to visually identify high-risk vehicles.
- An optional **penalty model** dynamically increases penalty points based on both odometer and engine hours:  
  `Penalty = 20 * (1 + alpha * (odometer / R_max)) * (1 + beta * h_ratio)`.

This approach ensures that incentives are risk-adjusted, and the output score is quantifiable and can be tokenized for use in modern blockchain-based incentive systems.
