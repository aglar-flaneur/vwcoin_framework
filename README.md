**VW Coin Algorithm**

Our algorithm dynamically evaluates each vehicle’s operational risk by combining *engine hours* (H), *distance traveled* (odometer), and *operational context* (urban, highway, off-road). Specifically:

1. **Risk Threshold:**  
   We compute a risk threshold \(T(H)\) that decreases as engine hours increase, following  
   \[
   T(H) = \frac{R_{\max}}{1 + \gamma \cdot H},
   \]  
   where \(R_{\max}\) is the maximum distance allowed under ideal conditions, \(\gamma\) is a sensitivity parameter (in 1/h), and \(H\) is the total engine hours.

2. **Risk Factor:**  
   We then derive a *Risk Factor* that increases with both the accumulated distance and engine hours. This factor may be used to color-code each data point, making it easy to identify high‐risk vehicles (those operating for long hours and covering large distances).

3. **Penalty (Optional):**  
   For certain analyses, we calculate a penalty score using a multiplicative model of odometer and engine hours, such as  
   \[
   \text{Penalty} = 20 \times \Bigl(1 + \alpha \frac{\text{odometer}}{R_{\max}}\Bigr) \times \Bigl(1 + \beta \, h_{\text{ratio}}\Bigr),
   \]  
   where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are coefficients that weight the impact of distance and engine hours, respectively.

In essence, the algorithm highlights vehicles or trips that pose higher risk (e.g., high engine hours, extensive mileage) and can optionally assign a penalty to them, making it straightforward to prioritize interventions or adjust operational strategies.
